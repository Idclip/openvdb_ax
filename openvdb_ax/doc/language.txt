@section secIntroduction Introduction

AX is designed to modify individual voxels of a collection of OpenVDB volume grids, or
individual points of a OpenVDB points grid.
This is achieved using the `@` syntax to write to either OpenVDB Point attributes or OpenVDB
Grid voxel values. An example of this may look as follows:

`int@value = 6;`

This snippet would set a point attribute named "value" or a the voxels of a grid
named "value" to be the integer value 6 depending on whether it was operation on
points or volumes. This will be done for every point or every voxel in the supplied grid.

Each statement needs to be finished with a semicolon as is the norm for C-like langauages.

For more examples of AX in action see the @subpage codeExamples "Code Examples" page.

@section secTypes Types

AX supports the following data types for OpenVDB Points attributes and local variables:

Type   | Definition                          | Attribute Syntax    | Local Variable Syntax |
-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
bool   | Boolean value, true or false.       | `bool@`             | `bool`                |
short  | 16-bit signed integer value.        | `short@`            | `short`               |
int    | 32-bit signed integer value.        | `int@`, `i@`        | `int`                 |
long   | 64-bit signed integer value.        | `long@`             | `long`                |
float  | 32-bit floating point value.        | `float@`, `f@`, `@` | `float`               |
double | 64-bit floating point value.        | `double@`           | `double`              |
vec3i  | 3-element vector of integer values. | `vec3i@`            | `vec3i`               |
vec3f  | 3-element vector of float values.   | `vec3f@`, `v@`,     | `vec3f`               |
vec3d  | 3-element vector of double values.  | `vec3d@`            | `vec3d`               |
string | A string of characters.             | `string@`, `s@`     | `string`              |

AX supports the following data types for OpenVDB grids:

Type   | Definition                          | Volume Syntax  |
-------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
bool   | Boolean value, true or false.       | `bool@`        |
int    | 32-bit signed integer value.        | `int@`, `i@`   |
long   | 64-bit signed integer value.        | `long@`        |
float  | 32-bit floating point value.        | `float@`, `f@` |
double | 64-bit floating point value.        | `double@`      |
vec3i  | 3-element vector of integer values. | `vec3i@`       |
vec3f  | 3-element vector of float values.   | `vec3f@`, `v@` |
vec3d  | 3-element vector of double values.  | `vec3d@`       |

Short and string values aren't supported by OpenVDB grids.
