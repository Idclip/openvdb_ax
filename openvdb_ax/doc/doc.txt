@section overview Overview
@par
<b>OpenVDB AX</b> is an open source C++ library that provides a powerful and
easy way of interacting with OpenVDB volume and point data. The software strives
to provide a concise, fast, highly parallalisable and portable solution to
performing custom manipulation of OpenVDB data via an expression language: AX.
AX expressions are JIT-compiled and used in combination with a multi-threaded
execution framework, specifically designed for VDB, that in many cases rival
custom C++ operators.
@par
<b>OpenVDB AX is currently in BETA</b>. This predominately means that the C++
API is subject to change without backward compatible guarantees.
@par
The software is currently hosted on <A HREF="https://github.com/dneg/openvdb_ax">github</A>
and has a variety of releases for download.

@subsection docs Documentation
@par
The doxygen documentation provide information on both AX as a language and the
developer documentation for OpenVDB AX as a C++ API. There are two main sections:
@par
 - The @subpage ax "AX Language Documentation" provides useful information for front-end users looking for documentation on the AX Language.
 - The @subpage openvdbaxbuild "Building OpenVDB AX" provides build instructions and requirements.
 - The @subpage openvdbax "OpenVDB AX Documentation" provides API and other C++ specific software information for developers.
@par
Some additional quick links to useful subsections of the documentation are also
provided:
@par
 - @subpage axexamples "Code Examples" for examples of OpenVDB AX in action.
 - @subpage axfunctionlist "AX Functions" for a list of all available AX functions.
 - @subpage vdbaxbuild "Building OpenVDB AX" for information on building <b>OpenVDB AX</b>.
