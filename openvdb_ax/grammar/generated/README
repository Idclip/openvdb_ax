This folder contains pre-generated grammar source and header files for
OpenVDB AX. The OpenVDB AX CMake build system copies these to the
intermediate build directory from where they are referenced. This
allows you to optionally re-generate the grammar yourself by
specifying OPENVDB_BUILD_AX_GRAMMAR during the first run of CMake.
